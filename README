# status

dhcp is implemented and lightly tested.  bootp is not yet implemented.  enough room for improvement.


# about

ip/dhcpd is a dhcpd (it also speaks bootp).  see the manual page for more information.


# install

make sure you have $ROOT set.  now run "mk install" to compile and
install the files.

when building from within inferno, insert SYSHOST=Inferno and ROOT=
in the mk invocations to override the values in the mkconfig.


# latest version

the latest version can be found at:

        http://www.ueber.net/code/r/dhcpd


# licence & author

this code was started as an extension to inferno's ip/bootpd, but has
been rewritten completely.

all files are in the public domain.  this code has been written by
mechiel lukkien, reachable at mechiel@ueber.net or mechiel@xs4all.nl.


# todo
- make Dhcpmsg less ugly
- check that we are serverid from request?
- return multiple dns servers when configured
- if a lease time is requested, and it's lower than the server-assigned (and reasonable), use the clients lease
- honour max message size in request?
- do host->ip conversion on values from ndb that have to be ip in dhcp options?  or just require them to be ip's?
- logging?
- implement bootp requests
- dhcp message option overload, for parsing
- respond with unicast in same cases (unless broadcast flag is set)
- broadcast flag must be set for some cases when sending to giaddr
- if giaddr is set in request, allocate address from that subnet?  or at least document that we're not doing that.
- test with various dhcp/bootp clients
- probe to-be-handed-out addresses to verify that they really are free?
- make more like plan 9's dhcpd?  e.g. dhcp option names.
